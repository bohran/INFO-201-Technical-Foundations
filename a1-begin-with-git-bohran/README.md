# **New Year's Resolution: 2018**
## Live Healthier
### Nicole Bohra

My goal for 2018 is to eat more fruits and vegetables and exercise more to accomplish a **healthier lifestyle**. I want to create a _plan_ for myself and also encourage my _peers_ to follow it so that they can also pursue a healthy lifestyle.
